Gloo Mesh is a multicluster and multimesh management plane that is based on open-source projects like Envoy and Istio. With Gloo Mesh, you can try out a suite of API tools to unify the configuration, operation, and visibility of service-to-service connectivity across your distributed applications. These apps can run in different virtual machines (VMs) or Kubernetes clusters on premises or in various cloud providers, and even in different service meshes.

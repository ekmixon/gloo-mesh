Use `meshctl` to install the Gloo Mesh management components into a cluster. The control plane components can be installed in a dedicated management cluster, or in a cluster that runs a service mesh.

**Dedicated management cluster**: Install Gloo Mesh in a dedicated cluster that does not run a service mesh. This cluster serves only as the management cluster in your setup, and is not a registered cluster. This deployment pattern is recommended for production-level setups, as shown in this diagram

![Management componenets installed in a dedicated management cluster]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/gloomesh-3clusters.png" %}})

**Service mesh cluster**: Install Gloo Mesh in a cluster that also runs a service mesh. This cluster serves as both the management cluster and as a registered cluster. This deployment pattern uses less resources and is useful for getting started with and exploring Gloo Mesh's capabilities. The guides throughout the Gloo Mesh Open Source documentation set follow this deployment pattern to install Gloo Mesh into a service mesh cluster, as shown in this diagram.

## Before you begin

* Install the following CLI tools:
  * [`meshctl`]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/setup/meshctl_cli_install/" >}}), the Gloo Mesh command line tool for bootstrapping Gloo Mesh, registering clusters, describing configured resources, and more.
  * [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl), the Kubernetes command line tool. Download the `kubectl` version that is within one minor version of your Kubernetes cluster.
* [Prepare at least two clusters]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/setup/kind_setup/" >}}) for your Gloo Mesh setup.
* Save the context for your management cluster in an environment variable, and set the context to the management cluster.
  ```shell
  export MGMT_CONTEXT=<management-cluster-context>
  kubectl config use-context $MGMT_CONTEXT
  ```

## Install Gloo Mesh

Install Gloo Mesh in the management cluster by using `meshctl`, Kubernetes resources, or Helm.

### Using meshctl

Use the Gloo Mesh command line tool to install the management components.
```shell
meshctl install community --kubecontext $MGMT_CONTEXT --version {{< readfile file="static/content/gmoss_latest_version.txt" markdown="true">}}
```

Example output:
```
Installing Helm chart
Finished installing chart 'gloo-mesh' as release gloo-mesh:gloo-mesh
```

### Using kubectl apply

To directly use the Kubernetes resources for installation, you can use the `--dry-run` flag in the `meshctl install` command to output YAML resource files. Then, you can use the files in automation or apply the files directly to yhe management cluster by using `kubectl apply`.

```shell
meshctl install community --dry-run --version {{< readfile file="static/content/gmoss_latest_version.txt" markdown="true">}}
```

{{% notice note %}}
The `--dry-run` flag outputs the entire YAML for the resources, but does not properly order resources. For example, race conditions can occur between Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that are registered and any Custom Resources (CRs) that are created. If this error occurs, you can simply re-apply the resources by using `kubectl apply`.

## Verify installation

1. After you install Gloo Mesh into the management cluster, view the management components that are installed.
   ```shell
   kubectl get pods -n gloo-mesh
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
   NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   discovery-66675cf6fd-cdlpq    1/1     Running   0          32m
   networking-6d7686564d-ngrdq   1/1     Running   0          32m
   ```

2. Verify that the components are install correctly.
   ```shell
   meshctl check server
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
   Gloo Mesh Management Cluster Installation

   ðŸŸ¢ Gloo Mesh Pods Status

   ðŸŸ¢ Gloo Mesh Agents Connectivity

   Management Configuration

   ðŸ”´ Gloo Mesh CRD Versions
     * deployments.apps "enterprise-networking" not found

   ðŸŸ¢ Gloo Mesh Networking Configuration Resources
   ```
   The `enterprise-networking` CRD is not found because the CRD is not included in a Gloo Mesh Open Source installation.

## Next steps

Next, you can [install an Istio service mesh into remote clusters]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/setup/installing_istio" %}}) and [register the remote clusters with Gloo Mesh]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/setup/community_cluster_registration" %}}).
